# Sendgrid_Function_App
Azure Function Email Sender

This code is an example of an Azure Function that sends an email using the SendGrid API. It prompts the user for employee information such as name, email address, and sending email address, and then sends an email using a dynamic email template.
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    SendGrid Python library (sendgrid)

Installation

    Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

    Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

    pip install sendgrid

Configuration

Before running the code, make sure to set the following environment variables:

    SENDGRID_API_KEY: The SendGrid API key used to authenticate requests to the SendGrid API.
    SENDGRID_TEMPLATE_ID: The ID of the dynamic email template to be used.
    FROM_EMAIL: The email address to be set as the "from" address for the email.

Usage

    Import the required modules and retrieve the SendGrid API key from the environment variable.
    Define the send_email function, which takes the employee name, employee email, and sending email as input.
    Create a Mail object and set the necessary properties:
        from_email: The "from" email address, retrieved from the FROM_EMAIL environment variable.
        to_emails: The email address to send the email to, provided as an input parameter.
        template_id: The dynamic email template ID, retrieved from the SENDGRID_TEMPLATE_ID environment variable.
        dynamic_template_data: A dictionary containing the dynamic data to populate the template, including the employee name and email address.
    Send the email using the SendGrid API by creating a SendGridAPIClient instance and calling the send method with the Mail object.
    Handle any exceptions that occur during the email sending process and provide appropriate error messages.
    Define the main function, which prompts the user for employee information and calls the send_email function.
    Call the main function if the script is executed directly.

Security Considerations

    Ensure that the environment variables containing sensitive information (API key, template ID, from email) are properly protected and not exposed in your code repository or public channels.
    Keep the SendGrid API key confidential and restrict access to authorized personnel.
    Avoid including any sensitive information in the dynamic email template content.
    Implement additional security measures such as access controls, authentication, and rate limiting to protect the Azure Function and its endpoints.

Remember to review the complete code and adapt it to your specific requirements before deploying it to your Azure Function app.

Please note that this documentation is a brief overview and should be complemented with thorough testing, security reviews, and best practices to ensure the robustness and security of your application.
